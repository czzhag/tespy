Instuction on fts analysis.

(1) Raw timestream data goes to /home/data/cryo/<DATE>/
(2) Use fts_quicklook.ipynb to see which detectors have usable 
    interferograms in each data file.
(3) Prepare filelist, fns.
(4) Prepare channel list for each data file, chns.
(5) Prepare filelist wlf. Use 
	python fts_grid_quicklook_v2.py yyyymmdd mcefilename mcecol mcerow
    Check if the red points in the output plots are really white light fringes. If not, you need to zoomin and find the roughly correct white light fringe.
    Copy (with necessary modifications) the wlf array to the filelist wlf.
(6) run fts_spec_v2.py
    Change 'from <filename> import flist' line to the correct filelist name
    Change 'import <mapping filename> as minfo' line to the correct mapping script.
    Change the vars at the beginning of the script accordingly.
